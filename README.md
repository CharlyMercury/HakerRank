Challenges

## Let's go to reach our goals 
I use to forget urls of my things, so I'll write the main url to my Hackerrank Dashboard.

I think it is very usefull tool to know our level in the lenguajes provided by HackerRank. 
So, in this repository I going to update all my challenges solutions. 

I am going to star with Python, but also want to solve C chanllenges, let me see, Sql and, maybe Regex. 
In this way, the folders of the repository are going to be ordered by lenguaje and inside this folder
by dificulty order, i.e., easy, medium and hard.
